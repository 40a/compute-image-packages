Description:
This dracut module will re-write the partition table of a disk so that the
root partition has as much space as possible, bumping it up to the edge of the
disk, or the edge of the next partition.

Local Modifications:
* Patched in el6 patches from the source RPM.
* Added sgdisk dependency to dracut module install as growpart requires sgdisk.
