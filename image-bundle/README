Image bundling tool for root file system.

To build a root filesystem tar
$ sudo gcimagebundle -r /dev/sda  -o /usr/local/google/home/${USER} \
  -k 'somekey' --loglevel=DEBUG  --log_file=/tmp/image_bundle.log

This will output the image tar in the output directory
specified with -o option.

Note that this is copied out file by file into the default google image.

To run unittest:
$ sudo python setup.py test
