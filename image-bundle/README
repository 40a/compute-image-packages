Image bundling tool for root file system.

To build a root filesystem tar
$ sudo ./image_bundle.py -r /data/myimage/root -o /usr/local/google/home/${USER} \
  -k 'somekey' --loglevel=DEBUG  --log_file=/tmp/image_bundle.log

This will output the image tar in the output directory
specified with -o option.

To run unittest:
$ mkdir /tmp/imagebundle
$ cp * /tmp/imagebundle/
$ sudo /tmp/imagebundle/block_disk_unittest.py

Note that this is copied out file by file into the default google image.
