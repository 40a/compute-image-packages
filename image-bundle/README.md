Image Bundle
Image Bundle is a python package that allows users to create an image from the current state of the running virtual machine. Image Bundle creates the image with the recommended packaging format and also allows you to run unit tests to verify that image bundle works properly on your operating system. See [Custom Images](https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/images#bundle_image) for more information.

To run unit tests:

    sudo python /usr/share/imagebundle/block_disk_unittest.py
